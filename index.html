          <h3 class="my-3">Due to COVID-19, many schools are transitioning to remote learning.
             Preschool and Kindergarten- age children are struggling to stay engaged in their coursework while learning from home.</h3>
            <p class="header-body my-3">Currently, teachers are conducting synchronous class with
               students over video conferencing tools, such as Zoom,
                and young students struggle to stay engaged in a virtual setting. 
                It is then often up to the parents to teach their kids at home, 
                but many parents are involved in remote work and don’t have the 
                time or expertise to plan lessons for their children.</p>

            However, the teachers and parents of these 
            students are also highly involved in their 
            youngster’s education, and are also critical

        <h2 class="mb-5">User Research</h2>
        <p class="header-body">We sent the parents of young children an online survey, 
          and conducted interviews with preK and Kindergarten teachers 
          to better understand our user’s current experiences and 
          difficulties with remote learning. By gathering data from 
          both groups, we were able to get a better understanding of 
          what issues the teachers, parents, and students are 
          having cohesively when young students are forced to learn from home.</p>
          <p class="header-body">
            However, we faced some limitations: most of the 
            parents and teachers we reached out to teach or send 
            their children to private schools. 
            This may have caused some bias in regards to resources 
            and technologies available for preK and Kindergarten 
            students, and the amount of parent involvement in their 
            children’s education. Additionally, we received fewer than 
            our desired number of responses on our parent survey 
            (target: 16 responses, actual: 14), which could have 
            led to our results not accurately representing the 
            population of 
            families with access to technology and reliable internet.
